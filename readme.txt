This will start as a very simple naval game in python.  I want to start with making a "ship" or object that can be maneuvered in the screen.  I will eventually add in enemy combatants, and the ability to fight them.

The following keys are used:
‘a’ – Steer left
‘d’ – Steer right
‘w’ – speed up
‘s’ – slow down or reverse
‘q’ - quit
